# 100PrisonerProblemPython
Demonstration of solution to 100 Prisoner Problem in Python

After Watching a Veritasium Video about the problem I decided to prove it via code.

I Decided to do it with Python because I'm starting to really like Python and thought it would be good practice.

Overall it was quite easy to make, I had some stupid errors which I won't talk about. 

I also liked the fact I was able to apply a binary Search because it was taking so long to run.

I guess that Data Structures and Algorithms Class finally did come in handy lol
